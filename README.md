"My first repository on GitHub."

I'm a determined “Kitchen Chef”, on a mission in the world of web/mobile development.

I have always been interested in IT and technology in general and have always loved the idea of being able to code but never had the opportunity to learn it within my grasp.

But recently I've decided that I want something more for my life, and now I'm taking the necessary
steps towards making my long time dream, come true. 

I'm married and have 4 kids, with a full time job without much time for
proper formal IT education so I've taken matters into my own hands(pun intended)!

With that said, I will spend any spare/free time I have, studying web/mobile
development/design online at several different online courses.

I'm an enthusiastic, fast learner, highly trainable, open minded, focused, ambitious,
determined, competitive, respectful person and self taught in various fields(Musician, Personal
Training, Nutritionist and Humanitarian HR management) including my current profession.

My life's motto for success “There are no impossibilities in life, only speed bumps” has been
what drives me forward.

I'm also aware that in order to achieve my ambitious goals, I'll need help and guidance from
more experienced developers throughout my journey.

Joining Github today hoping to be able add up to the awesome comunity of developers that make GitHub what it is today!

I'm planning to try and learn and to possibily help others in the future as I progress in my learning experience!
